If you have maven properly installed and you want to configure intelliJ terminal with a custom Terminal 
or if you want fix "command not found",follow these steps:
 1. Click > File 
 2. Click > Settings
 3. Click > Tools
 4. Click > Terminal
 5. Edit "Shell path" @ "Application Settings", if you use git bash change current path with:
   **C:\Users\Work\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\bin\sh.exe --login**

   // The path you may have differs based on your OS, in example: 
   "installationPath\Terminal Folder\bin\sh.exe --login"

 6. Click > Apply
 7. Click > Ok

I used git bash but technically it should work with every terminal. 
Do not forget to add --login after the *.exe

If it still doesn't work maybe you need to check:
 1. Click > Environment variables
 2. Click > System Properties
 3. Click > Environment Variables
 4. Click > System Variables
 5. Select > Path from the list
 6. Click > Edit 
 7. Click > New

Insert the path of your maven bin folder, in example:
 - "installationPath\apache-maven-3.8.6\bin"

Also insert the path of your jdk, in example:
 - "installationPath\Java\jdk-18.0.1.1"
